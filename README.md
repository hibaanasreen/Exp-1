# Exp-1 ATM & BANKING SYSTEM

# AIM:
To design and implement UML diagrams for an ATM & Banking System that models the functional requirements and workflow of the system.

# SRS (Procedure):
1.Identify the objectives and scope of the system.

2.Collect and analyze user and system requirements.

3.Specify functional and non-functional requirements.

4.Prepare, review, and finalize the SRS document

# RESULT:
Thus, the ATM & Banking System was successfully analyzed and modeled using UML diagrams. The diagrams clearly represent the system’s structure, behavior, and interaction between users and system components.
