# Exp-1 ATM & BANKING SYSTEM

# AIM:
To design and implement UML diagrams for an ATM & Banking System that models the functional requirements and workflow of the system.

# SRS (Procedure):
1.To design a model for the ATM & Banking System using UML diagrams.

2.To understand the interaction between customer, ATM, and bank server.

3.To identify system functionalities like withdrawal, deposit, and balance inquiry.

4.To represent system behavior and structure through visual diagrams.

# RESULT:
Thus, the ATM & Banking System was successfully analyzed and modeled using UML diagrams. The diagrams clearly represent the system’s structure, behavior, and interaction between users and system components.
